# Redux Feedback Loop

This app allows users to leave feedback on how they are feeling, understanding, support, and write a comment.  The feedback is then stored on a database.  

## Description

Duration: weekend project

The challenge was getting redux to store the values before final sumbit to the database.  The other challenge was using Material UI for the layout of the different pages.
